<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>This &quot;Explanatory Discourse&quot; first appeared, in the latter part of
  March 1773, annexed to the second and last edition of Sir William
  Chambers' <i>Dissertation on Oriental Gardening</i> of the preceding
  May. As an effort, curiously hedged, to impersonate a Chinese
  spokesman it seeks to exploit the satiric vantage points of philosophic
  naivety and trenchant candor enjoyed by Goldsmith's
  observer Lien Chi Altangi in London a dozen years earlier. But
  Chambers' ventriloquism is both more defensive and more aggressive
  than what we find in <i>The Citizen of the World</i>; the Preface
  here in his own voice admits sensitivity to the &quot;abuse&quot; which the
  Dissertation had incurred for its scenic fantasy, its brief opening
  and closing attacks on &quot;Capability&quot; Brown, and its pervasive criticism
  of the blandness of Brownian landscaping. By assuming the
  voice of Tan Chet-qua Chambers is able to pretend to more authoritative
  familiarity with actual Chinese gardens even as he deplores
  his readers' misapprehension that his interest lay mainly in masquerade,
  entertainment, or &quot;the mere recital of a traveller's observation&quot;
  (p. 113). It was probably a strategic error to entrust the
  substance of his genuine and quite respectable challenging of
  Brownian style, to what he terms the &quot;vehicle&quot; of alleged first-hand
  reports of preferable &quot;Chinese&quot; lay-outs. By this date, some two
  decades after the chinoiserie fad had crested in England, most of his
  readers might fairly be termed rather jaded. They preferred to overreact
  to the frivolity and whimsey they had come to think essentially
  Chinese, rather than to ponder what Chambers seriously
  urges from behind his silken &quot;screen&quot;: his interest in a variegated
  emotional response to deliberately variegated landscape. An admirer
  of Burke's Sublime, Chambers saw advantage in complicating
  the suavity of Brown's gentle contours, shaven lawns, free-form
  reflecting lakes, and still short tree-clumps, through a program of
  landscaped stimulation of contrasting associative moods. This is
  the essence of that argument which Chambers &quot;cloathed ... in the
  garb of fiction, to secure it a patient hearing&quot; (p. 112) in three
  publications appearing over sixteen years. There is no evidence that
  he was better understood through publication of this &quot;Discourse,&quot;
  the last of the three.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>
<p>Of course, it is not as a satirist, an aesthetician of landscape, or
  even as a masquerading orientalist that Sir William Chambers
  (1723-96) has been best known in his time and since: with Robert
  Adam, he led the British architectural profession virtually from the
  time he undertook his first commissions around 1757. The two
  buildings for which he is justly best remembered are the Chinese
  Pagoda at Kew Gardens and Somerset House, between London's
  Strand and Waterloo Bridge. Yet from that solid Palladian structure
  now housing the General Register Office it takes more than the
  dozen miles up Thames to reach the pagoda which in 1762 reared
  its eighty bright wing-displaying dragons on ten successive roofs,
  and from the height of fifty meters flashed its glazed tiles across
  suburbia. Chambers developed simultaneously and maintained
  through his career two contrasted sensibilities. The dignified town
  house he designed for his family in 1764 fronted Berners Street with
  a massive rusticated doorway, yet had interior chimney-pieces and
  a rear elevation modelled in &quot;fanciful&quot; papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; which his
  biographer John Harris supposes was painted and varnished chinoiserie.
  He made his way to the top of his profession and earned
  royal recognition through tectonic skills that absorbed him with
  Somerset House, for instance, during the last two decades of his
  life. But as early as 1752 he had ventured the striking practice&mdash;standard
  by the century's end through his pioneering and Adam's&mdash;of
  drawing elevations of a building proposed as it would appear
  if already conditioned by time, decaying and overgrown by vegetation.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Deciding what to make of his three publications on Chinese
  gardens will not be eased by polarizing his sources of inspiration or
  consigning his life into stretches during which the dominant interest
  was product or process, structure or affect. Here is no schizoid or
  frustrated Pre-Romantic&mdash;a Chatterton who somehow survived his
  suicide attempt to edit copy for the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>&mdash;but a
  consummate professional.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The mythic &quot;Cina&quot; of which this &quot;Discourse&quot;
  was Chambers' latest account grew and changed with him
  from his first-hand experience of Canton at the age of twenty,
  through his architectural training in Paris and Rome, and throughout
  his practice and success as the Establishment architect of his age
  in England.</p>
<p>The recent thorough Harris biography leaves it appropriate here
  only to survey the facts most pertinent to his publications on
  Chinese gardens and to advance a few speculations. The first son of
  a well-to-do Scottish sutler to the armies of Charles XII of Sweden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span> Chambers early left his native Gothenburg for schooling supervised
  by relatives in Yorkshire. Between the ages of 17 and 26 his cosmopolitan
  rearing proceeded with his apprenticeship to supercargoes
  or agents aboard three successive vessels of the Swedish East India
  Company trading in ports along the Indian coast and as far east as
  Canton. Although his eye and sketchbook were thus early busied
  with oriental sights, what Chambers later wrote of Peking (or much
  else Chinese beyond the docks of Canton) was, as he admitted,
  based upon the observations of others. Yet it must have been rare
  and significant enough in those days that when this Westerner
  determined to devote his earnings from the final voyage to an
  education in architecture, he had seen proportionately so much of
  non-European building. Even before enrolling in J.-F. Blondel's
  Ecole des Arts for the 1749-50 winter, Chambers may have met
  Frederick, Prince of Wales, in London, and been encouraged by
  Frederick's exotic interests.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It was during his second of five springs
  in Rome, living with his English wife over the shop of Piranesi, that
  Chambers learned of Frederick's death in March 1751 and designed
  for him a mausoleum based on the ancient and neo-classical shapes
  before his eyes; in one of his sections for this project he depicted it
  decaying like some of them, with cypress trees beginning to grow
  out of the rubble that was to have been its roof! Though this design
  was never executed, Chambers did meet with royal patronage upon
  his return to London and dedicated to the new Prince of Wales&mdash;soon
  his pupil in drawing, and three years later, George III&mdash;his
  first book, <i>Designs of Chinese Buildings, Furniture, Dresses,
  Machines and Utensils</i> in 1757.</p>
<p>The opening sentences which Samuel Johnson contributed to
  Chambers' <i>Designs</i> scorned the &quot;power&quot; with which &quot;novelty
  attracts regard&quot;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;a ground-note directly contrary to Chambers'
  sarcastic apology for &quot;the monster Novelty&quot; here in his 1773
  Preface. But in 1757 he could expect his crisp text and twenty-one
  plates to administer a calming dose of authenticity to the chinoiserie
  fever then raging. In fact, this large and handsome volume
  appears to have driven from the market the pattern-books of
  &quot;William Halfpenny&quot; and others, with their ridiculous dragon-finials
  atop Georgian hip-roofs and Venetian windows bordered by
  crockets&mdash;the carpentry trade trying to sustain a mood for renovations
  waning by the early fifties. Chambers hoped to put a stop
  &quot;to the extravagancies that daily appear under the name of
  Chinese, though most of them are mere inventions, the rest copies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> from the lame representations found on porcelain and paper-hangings.&quot;
  This sniffy professionalism would broaden by 1772
  into mockery of the &quot;kitchen gardeners, well skilled in the culture
  of sallads, but little acquainted with the principles of Ornamental
  Gardening&quot;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;which everyone took for a swipe at Launcelot
  &quot;Capability&quot; Brown, &quot;yon stately gentleman in the black perriwig&quot;
  (p. 157 below).</p>
<p>Yet probably a more general and generous motive prompted
  Chambers to boost in this public way, on the last five pages introducing
  his <i>Designs</i>, a landscape-style in which he could hardly
  expect to exercise his training or build the career just beginning.
  The lay-outs of Kent and Brown took inspired advantage of topography,
  plants and climate peculiar to the south of England, but to
  anyone coming like Chambers from the gardens in and near Paris
  and Rome it might appear by 1757 that the English style risked
  parochial self-exaggeration to the point where all anecdotal human
  interest would be suppressed in the name of a &quot;Nature&quot; literally
  isolated. Cosmopolitanism, more enlightened than ever, befitted a
  Britain engaged in Pitt's &quot;Great War for the Empire&quot; which would
  extend its holdings from Montreal to Madras. Was there not an
  earlier empire whose leader had left visible tokens of his eclecticism?
  &quot;[H]Adrian, who was himself an architect, at a time when the
  Grecian architecture was in the highest esteem among the Romans,
  erected in his Villa, at Tivoli, certain buildings after the manner of
  the Egyptians and of other nations.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It was timely to identify a
  pure &quot;original&quot; example of culture native to quite another organic
  whole, and then to transplant it intact to a British scene large
  enough to sustain it. Botanically viewed, this is the principle on
  which arduous horticultural experiments were being performed at
  this stage in England's imperial history: the removal to Kew of
  Lebanese cedars, oriental Ginkgoes, persimmons and Sophoras, or
  American locusts in the earlier 1750s, and later, the infamous
  Bounty venture to transplant in Jamaica breadfruit from the South
  Seas. Architecturally applied, it would seem to be the principle on
  which Chambers developed his designs for a score of buildings after
  the manner of the Romans, Chinese, Moors, and of other nations,
  erected at Kew Gardens by the time the Treaty of Paris was signed
  in 1763.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In this concern he seconded but went beyond the hopes of
  Horace Walpole and William Mason that &quot;this whole kingdom
  might soon become one magnificant vast Garden, bounded only by
  the sea&quot; (below, page 133). The syntax of Lewis Mumford seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> apposite: of Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of New York's
  Central Park just a century later, Mumford has remarked that &quot;By
  making nature urbane he naturalized the city.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> At Kew, by
  making the garden cosmopolitan, Chambers helped to globalize the
  capital of empire and proposed the world as Enlightened Eden.</p>
<p>It was not, of course, such national or global edenic visions
  which chiefly exercised readers of Chambers' 1757 essay &quot;Of the
  Art of Laying Out Gardens Among the Chinese&quot; and brought down
  upon his 1772 <i>Dissertation</i> the ridicule which prompted the
  &quot;Explanatory Discourse.&quot; Rather, it was the lurid details through
  which both accounts maintained that &quot;The Chinese artists,
  knowing how powerfully contrast operates on the mind, constantly
  practise sudden transitions, and a striking opposition of forms,
  coulours, and shades.&quot; Though this principle earned sympathetic
  response from theorists like Burke and Karnes at home and Delille
  on the Continent, Chambers pressed his luck too far when he
  described what he claimed to have observed, or heard from
  Chinese observers, of &quot;three different species of scenes, to which
  they give the appellations of pleasing, horrid, and enchanted.&quot;
  Particularly vulnerable were the programmed <i>frissons</i> of &quot;their
  scenes of horror&quot;: &quot;some miserable huts dispersed in the mountains
  serve, at once to indicate the existence and wretchedness of the
  inhabitants.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> By 1772 the <i>Schadenfreude</i> has deepened: &quot;Their
  scenes of terrour are composed of gloomy woods, &amp;c. gibbets,
  crosses, wheels, and the whole apparatus of torture are seen from
  the roads. Here too they conceal in cavities, on the summits of the
  highest mountains, foundries, lime-kilns, and glass-works, which
  send forth large volumes of flame, and continued columns of thick
  smoke, that give to these mountains the appearance of volcanos.&quot;
  This was the sort of opening which William Mason exploited in
  his <i>Heroic Epistle to Sir William Chambers</i> of March, 1773:</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">Now to our lawns of dalliance and delight,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Join we the groves of horrour and affright;<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">This to achieve no foreign aids we try,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Thy gibbets, Bagshot! shall our wants supply;<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Hounslow, whose heath sublimer terrour fills,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Shall with her gibbets lend her powder mills.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><br />
    </span> </div>
</div>
<p>Mason's <i>Heroic Epistle</i> was one of the century's most popular
  poems and, cheered on by Walpole, a viscously successful effort to
  tar with Chambers' lavish brush his patron George Bute and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> assorted Scots, any critic of Brown, and the Tory establishment at
  large.</p>
<p>Yet behind Chambers' oriental screen the novelty, enduring
  interest, and even the practicality of some of his ideas can be
  observed. That concern to naturalize the smoky mills of industrialization
  may be developing a hint (concerning Middleton Dale, in the
  Peak District) on page 94 of Thomas Whately's supremely influential <i>Observations on Modern Gardening</i> (1770). If Chambers'
  generation was neither the first nor last to grapple with what
  &quot;progress&quot; had done to the land, the English landscaping movement
  presented a new stage for that encounter. While Chet-qua's proposal
  to frame the dreary tracts around a metropolis &quot;into scenes of
  terror&quot; seems less than helpful, how neatly he anticipates C&eacute;zanne's
  transfer of his easel into the abandoned Bib&eacute;mus Quarry (pp. 130-132).
  Foreshadowing William Cowper's satire of &quot;Th' omnipotent
  magician, Brown&quot; in <i>The Task</i>, Chambers had warned that estate-&quot;improvement&quot;
  could lead to irreparable devastation of the
  nation's woodland. Several of Chambers' means to certain effects
  sound more like a practical landscape architect at work than a
  Disneyland impressario parading his promised thrills: when he
  urges diversification of material relative to seasonal change or
  human entertainments, for instance, or the use of wire fencing and
  other substitutes for the ha-ha. His interest in the harmonizing of
  diverse but massed hues and textures has been recognized as an
  early glimpse of the &quot;English&quot; effects secured by Gertrude Jekyll a
  century and a quarter later.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Though extravagances of Chambers'
  language distracted attention from the liberalism of his views, such
  passages of the <i>Dissertation</i> as pp. 49-50 read like the Picturesque
  identified by William Gilpin, Uvedale Price, and Richard Payne
  Knight in the 1780s and '90s. Far from the (Sino-British) imperial
  privity which Mason tartly mocked are Chet-qua's suggestions that
  the country-house owner drop his palings and open his grounds to
  &quot;Holy-day folks,&quot; as he opens his Park to his kitchen-garden. More
  than this, he should offer &quot;meats for every palate,&quot; plan not for his
  family or honored guests alone, but for tastes more susceptible to
  surprise than theirs. Likewise the circuit plan would be well replaced
  by another less coercive.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Points like these reveal in Chambers
  a solicitude on behalf of a general public of garden-strollers
  not at all necessarily landholding, nor self-conscious as &quot;connoisseurs.&quot;
  Perhaps this is why, when the planners grouped around
  Nikolaus Pevsner and his <i>Architectural Review</i> surveyed their task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> in post-war England, they would find fresh applications for the term
  &quot;picturesque&quot; and fresh relevance in this Tory's &quot;Chinese&quot; gardens.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Sinologists and landscape-historians have long recognized,
  to be sure, that Chambers' descriptions (like most of what the West
  has wrought in the name of Chinese gardening since Sir William
  Temple enunciated his shadowy <i>sharawadgi</i> principle in 1685),
  while they may correctly celebrate specific details, or the general
  principles of surprise and variety, register no sensitivity to the
  Taoist or Buddhist teleology crucial to oriental planning. What
  Chet-qua calls &quot;supernatural scenery&quot; is hence &quot;enchanted&quot; by the
  same spirit of diversion animating the Druid or Dark Walk and
  subterranean Fairy Music of Vauxhall Gardens, across the Thames
  from Somerset House.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Enlightened secularization of the genuine
  oriental principles of immanence and affect may, however, be
  exactly what makes a paragraph on page 52 of the 1773 <i>Dissertation</i> sound so much like a ground-plan for a short story of strollers'
  interwoven and inconsequential conversations and interior monologues,
  Virginia Woolf's &quot;Kew Gardens.&quot;</p>
<p>If allowances are made for the persistent difficulty of transcribing
  Chinese phonemes, and for Chambers' dependence upon
  Cantonese rather than Mandarin dialect, the oriental dress of the <i>Discourse</i> is less bogus than might be assumed. Chambers' varying
  spellings of the then reigning emperor's name would exemplify the
  first problem, my failure to authenticate the poem on pages 118-119
  the second. (Over 42,000 unindexed poems in Mandarin are attributed
  to this emperor, now known here as Ch'ien-lung.) Proustian
  though they may seem to Westerners, the synesthetic effects of tea-taking
  and the evocativeness of the scents and hues of &quot;Mei-hoa&quot;
  (plum-blossom), &quot;fo-cheou&quot; (chrysanthemum), and pine are indeed
  celebrated in much Chinese poetry.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Whoever wrote the
  poem, it aptly dramatizes the suggestible ethos which Chambers
  recommends to English artists and their public.</p>
<p>This &quot;Discourse&quot; is appreciably more puckish in tone than the
  earlier two-thirds of Chambers' published &quot;Chinese&quot; work. The
  half-title here, page [109] of the second edition, heaps Chambers'
  own initialed honors<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> upon the Canton &quot;Gent.&quot; Chet-qua, and
  with the ironies of his Preface and elaborate courtesies of the Introduction,
  the fun has begun. Identification of a Chinese alter ego
  enables Chambers to claim a kind of diplomatic immunity for both
  his enthusiasms and his judgments against the English style. By
  half-heartedly ascribing the preceding 107 pages of <i>Dissertation</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> also to Chet-qua, and receding as mere &quot;Editor&quot; of the lovable old
  gourmet's remarks (page 148n), he trusts to keep one step ahead of
  his Whig adversaries. With exemplary tolerance such as had enhanced
  the European stereotype of the Chinese sage throughout the
  century, Chet-qua finds more to commend in French and Italian
  gardens, more to tease disarmingly in the Dutch, than Chambers
  had earlier. Finally, since an actual Chinese artist-about-town usually
  known as Chitqua had only recently returned to Canton,
  Chambers may have hoped his masquerade could stir British hospitality
  for his ideas. Within weeks of reaching London in August
  1769, Chitqua had had a royal audience. The miniature portrait
  busts he modelled in clay at ten guineas apiece, as well as his delicate
  manners and physique (&quot;the eyelashes almost always in
  motion&quot;) earned the admiration of Wedgwood's friend Thomas
  Bentley. One of his busts was shown in the 1770 Royal Academy
  exhibition, and during that year he visited Oxford, met Chambers
  and Bishop Percy, and sat down with Horace Walpole among
  others at the first official Academy dinner. Lashes and all, he
  figures in Zoffany's &quot;Life School of the Royal Academy,&quot; painted in
  1771. But what peculiarly recommends Chitqua to Chambers' purposes
  here is perhaps a mob's intervention at the start of his homeward
  voyage to Canton that spring, when xenophobia and &quot;the
  superstitious fears of the mariners&quot; forced him to return to London
  for another ship. On page 141 Chambers differs from the <i>Gentleman's
  Magazine</i> reporter who had Chitqua &quot;accidentally ... fall
  overboard&quot; at Gravesend, but whatever the facts, the parallel to
  Jonah at Joppa might be as clear to Chet-qua's adversaries as it was
  to that reporter and win the &quot;Discourse&quot; a more candid hearing
  than the <i>Dissertation</i> had enjoyed.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> To an unidentified reader of
  his first edition Chambers had justified such artfulness, and his
  entire &quot;Chinese&quot; myth for the promotion of a change in landscaping-style,
  this way: &quot;I thought it necessary to move in an exalted
  sphere. Our Gardeners, and I fear our Connoisseurs too, are such <i>tame</i> animals, that much sparring is necessary to keep them properly
  on their haunches.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Such quixotic energy even Mason had to

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>
<p>Every new system naturally meets with opposition;
  when the monster Novelty appears, all parties, alarmed
  at the danger, unite to raise a clamour: each cavils at
  what it doth not like, or doth not comprehend, till the
  whole project is pulled to pieces, and the projector stands
  plumed of every feather; not only robbed of the praise
  due to his labour and good intentions, but, like a
  common enemy, branded with scorn and abuse. In the
  first hurry of criticism, every deviation is accounted an
  error; every singularity an extravagance; every difficulty
  a visionary's dream: warm with resentment, biassed by
  interests and prejudices, the angry champions of the
  old, rarely show mercy to the new; which is almost
  always invidiously considered, and too often unjustly
  condemned.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>Sensible of these difficulties, the Author of the foregoing
  Dissertation, written in direct opposition to the
  stream of fashion, harboured no sanguine hopes of fame
  from his Publication: far from expecting at the first,
  either applause or encouragement, he even judged
  artifice necessary to screen him from resentment; and
  cloathed truth in the garb of fiction, to secure it a
  patient hearing.</p>
<p>The success of his little work, however, in one sense,
  far exceeded expectation: at its first appearance here, it
  found not only a patient, but a very indulgent reception;
  and it has since been equally fortunate in France, and
  other parts of Europe; where Monsieur Delarochette's
  elegant translation has made it known.</p>
<p>Yet flattering as this extensive suffrage may seem, it
  is in reality rather mortifying to the Author; who finds,
  from the nature of the encomiums bestowed upon his
  performance, that it has been more generally liked than
  understood; and that, whilst a few have honoured it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> with a deliberate reading, and separated the substance
  from the vehicle in which it was contained, far the
  greater number have mistaken the mask for the reality,
  and considered it simply as a pleasing tale; as the mere
  recital of a traveller's observation; or, as the luxuriant
  effusions of a fertile imagination, a splendid picture of
  visionary excellence.</p>
<p>Whether these misapprehensions arose from want of
  perspicuity in the writer, or want of attention in the
  readers, admits of no dispute; the former was most
  probably the case. The Author therefore, who wishes
  to be perfectly understood, and is more ambitious of
  being useful than entertaining, humbly begs leave to
  offer, at the end of this second edition, such reasons and
  explanations as seem necessary, either to remove doubts,
  or clear obscurities; he flatters himself they will be found
  sufficient, and serve to place the work in its true, its most
  advantageous light.</p>
<p>Of these illustrations he saw the necessity some time
  ago, and framed them into a Discourse supposed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> pronounced by Chet-qua, then in England; judging it,
  at that time, a sort of propriety to put in the mouth of
  a Chinese, what farther information was wanted relative
  to his country.</p>
<p>But as there is now no longer any necessity for disguise,
  both the Dissertation and Explanatory Discourse ought
  certainly to appear in their natural dress. To new-model
  them, however, would require more time than the Author
  can possibly spare; he therefore has republished the
  Dissertation, in its original form, and the Discourse as it
  was originally written; hoping the indulgent reader will
  pardon these defects, and gather the fruit, if there be
  any to gather, without minding the trees on which it
  grows.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>Introduction.</i></h2>
<p>All the world knew Chet-qua, and how he was born
  at Quang-chew-fu,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in the fourth moon of the year
  twenty-eight; also how he was bred a face-maker, and
  had three wives, two of whom he caressed very much;
  the third but seldom, for she was a virago, and had large
  feet. He dressed well, often in thick sattin; wore nine
  whiskers and four long nails, with silk boots, callico
  breeches, and every other ornament that Mandarins are
  wont to wear; equalling therein the prime macarones,
  and s&ccedil;avoir vivres, not only of Quang-chew, but even
  of Kyang-ning, or Shun-tien-fu. Of his size; he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> a well-spoken portly man, for a Chinese; a pretty general
  scholar; and, for a heathen, a very compleat gentleman.
  He composed a tieh-tse, or billet-doux, at pleasure;
  recited verses, either in Mantchou or Chinese, and sung
  love-songs in many languages. He likewise danced a
  fandango, after the newest taste of Macao, played
  divinely upon the bag-pipe, and made excellent remarks;
  which, when he lodged at Mr. Marr's, in the Strand, he
  would repeat to his friends over a pipe, as often as they
  pleased; for he was fond of smoaking, provided the
  tobacco was good; and, upon these occasions, was
  always vastly pleasant, and very communicative.</p>
<p>Amongst his favourite topics were painting, music,
  architecture and gardening; to the last of which he
  seemed most affected, often disserting thereon till he was
  tired, and the audience fast asleep; for the tone of his
  voice was like opium to the hearers; his method was
  diffuse, and the subject, though a good one, not generally
  interesting.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>One day he launched out into a long description of
  the Eastern Gardens, especially those of his own country,
  to which he was exceedingly partial; and, in the conclusion,
  compared them to a splendid feast, at which
  there were pleasures for every sense, and food for every
  fancy; whilst our Gardens, he said, were like Spartan
  broth, which was disgustful to all but Spartan palates;
  or like the partial niggardly treats of the fable, adapted
  only to organs of a peculiar construction: he advanced
  many other odd positions, spoke very freely, as well of
  our Gardeners, as Gardens, and ended recommending
  the Chinese taste, in preference to all others.</p>
<p>We were diverted with the discourse, from its singularity,
  and the variety of new ideas in which it abounded; yet
  as it ran in direct opposition to the general opinion and
  usage of England, and recommended a system which
  appeared to us rather visionary than practicable, we animadverted
  upon all its parts with the utmost freedom;
  neither sparing the speech nor speaker in any particular.</p>

<p>The severity of our criticism at first disconcerted poor
  Chet-qua, who remained silent, and in apparent confusion;
  but, after a short pause, he reassumed his usual good
  humour, his countenance cleared up, he arose, bowed to
  the company, and stroking his nine whiskers, began the
  following discourse.</p>

<p>If, in the hurry and warmth of speaking, Chet-qua has
  used expressions that seemed disrespectful, or inadvertently
  started notions that appeared extravagant, as you, Gentlemen,
  are pleased to assert, it is more than he intended;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span><br />
  his sole aim at this meeting, has been to point out a style
  of Gardening preferable to your's; and to shew how
  much more may be done in that Art, than has hitherto
  been thought on, by your or any other European nation:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span><br />
  to enumerate impossibilities, or amuse an audience with
  golden dreams and glittering shadows, would answer no
  useful purposes; and could, therefore, neither be the
  business nor intention of Chet-qua, who speaks not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span><br />
  the pleasure of speaking, nor with a desire of tickling
  the ear, but with the hope of being serviceable; he
  laments his want of perspicuity, to which alone your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> misapprehensions must be imputed; and begs leave to
  trespass on your patience a few moments longer, to
  explain himself more clearly, and endeavour to remove
  your prejudices against him.</p>
<p>He is sorry to have been under a necessity of censuring,
  even in a distant manner, what seemed to him imperfect
  amongst you; but whoever would be instrumental in the
  advancement of science, must declare his mind freely,
  and sometimes enforce his precepts by examples that
  exist: his observations have been as general as the subject
  would permit; for it is never his inclination to give
  offence; yet where truth is to be investigated, the truth
  must necessarily be told; else little or no progress can
  ever be made: where men play the sycophants, and
  tacitly suffer, or meanly applaud, what they do not
  approve; no amendment can ever be expected.</p>
<p>It is true, that dissentions in opinion, however well
  meant, will often bear an invidious aspect, and always
  must offend some interested individuals; yet, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> community, they are generally advantageous, and should
  always be favourably received, as they give birth to new
  discoveries, and ultimately point out the highest perfection:
  had no man ever ventured to dissent from his
  neighbour, our age would be as dark as were those of
  Fo-hii, Shing tong, or Whoang-tii;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and I am firmly
  persuaded, that your English Gardening would now have
  been much more perfect, had any one ever dared to dispute
  its excellence: but to dissent, is an unthankful
  business; a dangerous talk, that few have spirits to
  undertake, particularly where party-rage is violent, at it
  now and then seems to be amongst you.&mdash;But I come to
  the point.</p>
<p>In China, our large Gardens are obtained at an almost
  incredible expence, and attended with many inconveniencys:
  amongst you, whose policy, whose manners
  are totally different from ours, they might often be had
  at a moderate charge, and without much trouble; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> formidable as they may at first appear, it is certain that
  most of their scenery is easily executed, when proper
  opportunities occur, which is frequently the case in
  Europe, particularly in England; where your illustrious
  families have large domains; where agriculture is neater
  and more various than in other countries; and where
  the face of nature is in general more luxuriant; as well
  as better contrasted.</p>
<p>It is natural enough for a stranger to be dazzled with
  the splendor of our Oriental plantations; upon a cursory
  inspection, to conclude them too vast, too magnificent,
  too expensive for European imitation; and that, in your
  part of the world, the greatest princes should not be
  indulged with such articles of luxury, calculated, as they
  seem, to exhaust their treasures, waste their lands, rob
  and oppress their subjects: but a more attentive examination
  will probably give birth to more favourable opinions, and
  serve to prove, that not only your princes, but even your
  private gentlemen, may emulate us in this particular very
  safely; and that our style of Gardening may be adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> amongst you, even in its whole extent, without being
  attended with any of the inconveniences just now
  recited.</p>
<p>It is not the fence that constitutes the Garden;
  Cobham, Stourton, Blenheim, would still be what
  they are, though the pales or walls by which they are
  enclosed were taken away: neither is privacy necessary
  to the essence of a Garden; for Richmond and Kew are
  surely the same, when open to all the world, as when
  they are only accessible to the Royal Family; nor is
  useful or profitable culture incompatible with the idea,
  either of our Chinese, or your English Gardening.</p>
<p>Any tract of land, therefore, whose characteristick
  expressions have been strengthened by art, and in which
  the spontaneous arrangements of nature have been corrected,
  improved and adorned by the hand of taste,
  ought to be considered as a Garden, though only fenced
  with common hedges, and although the roads or paths
  passing through it be publick, and the grounds of which
  it is composed cultivated to the utmost advantage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>There remains then no obstacle to your rivalling the
  Chinese, either in the grandeur or extent of their Gardens:
  in which, you seem to fix, the insuperable difficulties of
  the imitation; since you have parks, forests, manors and
  royalties, some even in private hands, more extensive than
  is necessary; and since these may be so improved, and
  converted into gardens upon the plan now mentioned,
  without waste of land, without invasion of property,
  without annoyance or seclusion of the public, and certainly
  with less damage or expence to the owner, than
  are usually incurred in the article of your common Gardening;
  as no chargeable keeping or fencing would be
  necessary, no grounds unprofitably employed, no considerable
  assistance from art wanted: for the features of
  real nature, being in themselves generally more perfect,
  as well as greater than the finest imitations, require very
  few helps; seldom any that are expensive.</p>
<p>Every artist, therefore, who has the fortune to meet
  with patrons of large possessions, and liberal sentiments,
  may give full scope to his imagination, and boldly apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> whatever he has seen, heard, or his own fancy may have
  suggested, that is great, extraordinary, or surprising: instead
  of confining his views to a few acres, to form a
  trifling composition, scarcely superior to the desert at a
  festival; and which, insignificant as it would be, none
  but the healthful and vigorous could ever see; he may
  convert a whole province into a Garden; where the
  spectator, instead of toiling on foot, as usual, to see a
  few nothings, and performing more revolutions than a
  horse in a mill, may wander over a whole country at his
  ease, in ships or in barges, in carriages or on horse-back,
  feasting the sight with scenes of the boldest dimensions,
  and contemplating the luxuriant varied productions of
  Nature, improved and nobly enriched by Art.</p>
<p>And permit me to say, that Gardens of this sort,
  would not only be more magnificent, but also much
  more beautiful and perfect in every respect, than any
  even amongst the best of your artificial performances.
  In the great style of Gardening, neatness is not only
  superfluous, but destructive of the principal intent: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> common roads, bridleways and paths, of a country,
  however wild, are always preferable to the stiff, formal,
  made walks of a Garden; they are, in themselves,
  grander, more natural, and may, with a very little
  assistance; a few accompanyments, be made as commodious,
  as rich, as varied, and as pleasant.</p>
<p>Fields covered with corn, turneps, beans, potatoes,
  hemp, or productions of a similar nature; meadows,
  pasture lands, hop grounds, orchards, and other parts
  of English culture; interwoven with common hedges, or
  blended with accidental plantations, require little, if
  any assistance from Art, to be more picturesque than
  lawns the most curiously dotted with clumps; and villages,
  country churches, farm-houses or cottages, when placed
  with judgement, and designed with taste, enrich and
  adorn a landscape as well as more expensive structures.</p>
<p>The rivers of Nature flow in forms that Art can never
  equal: their natural modifications, particularly in
  mountainous places, are sufficiently numerous; a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> management heightens or diminishes all their expressions,
  varies their appearances, and adapts them to scenes of
  any character: their banks are soon adorned, even in the
  richest manner; for roses, a thousand other shrubs, and
  most perennial flowers, will grow as easily, and with as
  little culture, as primroses and briars do. A few of
  these, a little planting properly employed, and blended
  with rural buildings, bridges, ruins, monumental urns,
  and other trifling decorations, spread over the whole
  an appearance that equals, even surpasses the most
  elaborate cultivation.</p>
<p>In every large tract of land, there generally are some
  places abundantly supplied with water, which often flows
  through uncouth marshy bottoms of little use or value to
  the owner: by raising heads at their extremities, these
  are easily overflowed; and lakes of very considerable
  dimensions may thus be obtained, often without much
  trouble, always with great advantages, as well in point
  of profit as of pleasure; and wherever it may be necessary
  to dig, in order to give a proper depth to the water, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> earth may be raised into islands of various shapes, which
  serve to complicate the forms, to enrich and beautify
  the scenery.</p>
<p>Though woods, from various causes, are now more
  rare than heretofore amongst you, yet are there, in most
  parts, some still remaining; their natural beauties are
  many, and little more is left for art to do in them, than
  to form roads, to thin or thicken them occasionally;
  where it may be wanting, to intersperse, amongst the
  plantations, a few proper shrubs and flowers; to open
  recesses, and to decorate them with objects; this done,
  they will be infinitely superior, in every respect, to any
  of the gaudy trifling confused plantations with which all
  your English-made Gardens are so crouded.</p>
<p>England abounds with commons and wilds, dreary,
  barren, and serving only to give an uncultivated appearance
  to the country, particularly near the metropolis:
  to beautify these vast tracts of land, is next to an impossibility;
  but they may easily be framed into scenes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> terror, converted into noble pictures of the sublimest cast,
  and, by an artful contrast, serve to enforce the effect of
  gayer and more luxuriant prospects.</p>
<p>On some of them are seen gibbets, with wretches
  hanging in terrorem upon them; on others, forges,
  collieries, mines, coal tracts, brick or lime kilns, glass-*works,
  and different objects of the horrid kind: what
  little vegetation they have, is dismal; the animals that
  feed upon it, are half-famished to the artist's hands;
  and the cottagers, with the huts in which they dwell,
  want no additional touches, to indicate their misery: a
  few uncouth straggling trees, some ruins, caverns, rocks,
  torrents, abandoned villages, in part consumed by fire,
  solitary hermitages, and other similar objects, artfully
  introduced and blended with gloomy plantations, would
  compleat the aspect of desolation, and serve to fill the
  mind, where there was no possibility of gratifying the
  senses.</p>
<p>In prosecuting a plan of this extensive nature, many
  other opportunities would present themselves to the able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> artist, of dignifying nature, and of heightening his compositions
  with all the force of novelty and grandeur;
  stone quarries, chalk pits, mines, might as easily be
  framed into vast amphitheatres, rustic arcades and
  perystiles, extensive subterraneous habitations, grottos,
  vaulted roads, and passages, as into other shapes; hills
  might, without much difficulty, be transformed into
  stupendous rocks, by partial incrustations of stone,
  judiciously mixed with turf, fern, wild shrubs and forest
  trees; gravel pits, or other similar excavations, might be
  converted into the most romantic scenery imaginable, by
  the addition of some planting, intermixed with ruins,
  fragments of sculpture, inscriptions, or any other little
  embellishments; and, in short, there would be no
  deviation, however trifling, from the usual march of
  nature, but what would suggest, to a fruitful imagination,
  some extraordinary arrangement, something to disguise
  her vulgarity, to rouse the attention of the spectator, and
  to excite in his mind a succession of strong and opposite
  sensations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p>It is thus that far the noblest part of our Chinese
  Gardens, and those which at first sight appear most impracticable,
  may be obtained even amongst the common
  dispositions of English nature; and the great might thus
  have pleasure-grounds, extensive and extraordinary as
  those of the East, without any very considerable expence:
  men of less note would naturally imitate their superiors,
  by embellishing their possessions in the same manner;
  and instead of spending large sums to fence and to lard a
  little field with twigs, to give it the name of a Garden,
  they would beautify their whole estate; which, by a
  proper attention to the &#339;conomical precepts of our Chinese
  Gardeners, might be done in such a manner as to
  encrease its value, as well as improve its appearance.</p>
<p>By these means this whole kingdom might soon become
  one magnificent vast Garden, bounded only by the sea;
  the many noble seats and villas with which it abounds,
  would give uncommon consequence to the scenery; and
  it might still be rendered more splendid, if, instead of
  disfiguring your churches with monuments, our Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> manner of erecting mausoleums by the sides of the roads
  was introduced amongst you; and if all your public
  bridges were adorned with triumphal arches, rostral
  pillars, bas-reliefs, statues, and other indications of
  victory, and glorious atchievements in war: an empire
  transformed into a splendid Garden, with the imperial
  mansion towering on an eminence in the center,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and the
  palaces of the nobles scattered like pleasure-pavilions
  amongst the plantations, infinitely surpasses any thing
  that even the Chinese ever attempted: yet vast as the
  design appears, the execution is certainly within your
  reach.</p>
<p>Such, as far as I am able to judge, continued our
  Orator, is the true application of nature to horticulture;
  perhaps the only one that can be attempted with success:
  wherever she is made in little, or introduced upon a confined
  plan, the effect is always trifling and bad, as will
  appear to any man of real taste, who inspects the artificial
  scenery even of your most approved gardens: Nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> admits of no reduction in her dimensions; trees will not
  grow in miniature; nor are her bold movements to be
  expressed upon the surface of a few acres: and not to
  mention any of your performances, it is scarcely in the
  power of the most consummate art, to imitate nature
  perfectly; nor were it possible, could the most skilful
  arrangements acquire their true effect, till after the
  expiration of many years: our children may see the
  perfection of what we plant; we never can.</p>
<p>Our eastern artists, therefore, seldom attempt to
  create, but rather imitate the tonsor, the habit-maker,
  the posture-master, and all the other polishers of man;
  who dispose, decorate, cleanse, clip, and add grace to
  what is already formed to their hands: to make nature,
  they say, is tedious and difficult beyond conception;
  but she may soon be embellished, her redundancys suppressed,
  her faults corrected, her wants supplied, her
  beauties improved, and set to view.</p>
<p>The truth of these assertions is, I think, apparent in
  many of your famous plantations; but the beauties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> improved natural scenery, the defects of artificial, are no
  where so strongly marked as at B&mdash;&mdash;m, the most
  magnificent seat I have yet seen in Europe. On our
  entrance into the Park, we were astonished at the sight
  of a stupendous palace, surrounded with one of the
  noblest scenes of nature that can be imagined; the extent
  is vast, the parts uncommonly large, the grounds naturally
  well contrasted, the transitions bold, the plantations
  in perfect maturity: what assistance was necessary from
  art, has hitherto been judiciously administered; the
  removal of some trees, has exposed to view beauties that
  seem before to have been concealed; the addition of
  some others, has enriched parts that were bare; and the
  trifling, though very judicious circumstance of raising
  a head at the end of a valley, has obtained a very considerable
  lake of water, which enriches and enlivens all
  the prospects; and which, by following the natural bent
  or windings of the valley, has taken, without any assistance
  from art, the most picturesque forms that could be
  desired: in short, the whole is now admirable; and, when
  improved to the utmost, according to the design of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> munificent owner, will yet be more so. Ornaments to
  characterize the Garden more strongly, are yet wanting,
  and some masterly finishing touches still very necessary:
  one only little twining path, within ten cubits of the
  fence, is certainly not in character with the grandeur of
  the place; but the fence may be removed; and there is
  room, even now, on the declivity of the banks, and by
  the sides of the lake, for more considerable walks, with
  many recesses, which, when made and decorated, will
  add variety to grandeur, and render the whole as entertaining
  and splendid, as it is now great.</p>
<p>You enjoy the sight of this noble prospect for more
  than a mile; when the little path is suddenly turned into
  a little wood, whence, after having advanced a few paces,
  you behold a piece of scenery, all artificial, which I
  cannot venture to describe in this presence: some of you,
  Gentlemen, have seen what it is; and, with all your
  national partiality, must allow, either that it proves the
  impossibility of creating nature with any degree of
  success; or, that the ablest of your countrymen have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> no talent that way; to create, or to improve, are indeed
  very different operations; the former of which requires
  infinitely the most skill: it is ten times more difficult
  to paint a picture, than to judge, or suggest improvements,
  in one already painted.</p>
<p>Hitherto I have only described of B&mdash;&mdash;m, what
  strangers usually see; but the whole park, above twelve
  miles in circumference, and several farms adjoining to it,
  are uncommonly beautiful, rich in old planting, in water,
  and in a great variety of picturesque sites and points of
  view; so that, with a very little dressing, with some
  assistance from the sister arts of architecture and sculpture,
  the whole might easily be converted into one large
  magnificent Garden.</p>
<p>And give me leave to observe, that these advantages
  are by no means peculiar to B&mdash;&mdash;m; England boasts
  at least a hundred other places, many as extensive, most
  of them as capable of improvement, in various ways;
  which, under the management of true artists, might soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> be made to rival the Tse-hiu and Chang-lin<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> of ancient days,
  the Yven ming, the Tchang tchun yven,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> or any of the
  present splendid pleasure Gardens of our sublime Emperor,
  Kieng-long; the torch of the east, and true descendant
  of Tay-tsoy, the providence of Heaven, whom Joss<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> preserve in flesh and good spirits.</p>
<p>It must, however, be confessed, that there is an inconveniency
  subsisting amongst you, which will always
  retard, and often prevent the execution of this extensive
  plan of Gardening; it is the licentiousness of your youth
  and common people, who delight in destroying every
  extraordinary thing that comes in their way: if a great
  man plants trees to shade and beautify a road, the people
  cut them down; if statues, or other pieces of sculpture,
  are set to adorn places of public resort, the boys pelt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> them with stones, till all their extremities are demolished:
  wherever there are buildings, or seats, even in your
  Royal Gardens, we see them constantly disfigured with
  scurrilous inscriptions, or obscene rhimes; and where
  there are any uncommon trees, they are divested of every
  branch within reach; the shrubs are robbed of their
  blossom; the flowers are trodden under foot; the birds
  and animals are destroyed: in short, no mischief, that
  drunken mirth or deliberate malevolence can suggest, is
  left undone. What pity that such destructive brutality
  should exist in a country so particularly favoured by
  Nature, and so capable of improvement in the highest
  degree; whilst, in every other part of the world, it is
  unknown, almost unheard of!</p>
<p>But there is a strong tincture of the rhubarb in all
  human competitions; and liberty, which has so many
  advantages, is, nevertheless, attended with some inconveniencies,
  of a very serious nature; amongst which,
  the ferocity of its lowest votaries is none of the least
  formidable. Since our arrival here last July, I have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> at least twenty of their boisterous pranks; in which, not
  to enumerate the broken windows, the bloody noses, the
  kicks, and the bastinadoes of other gentlemen, I have
  myself been a melancholy sufferer upon various occasions;
  particularly at Portsmouth, where I was thrown into the
  sea, and narrowly escaped drowning, for the diversion
  of the company. Would to Heaven!&mdash;as I say to the
  mistress Chet-quas in a morning&mdash;would to Heaven, my
  ducks, we were well at Quang-chew-fu again, with all
  our long nails, and all our whiskers about us! The
  rigours of an Emperor are less frightful to me, than the
  frolics of a savage mob, elevated to madness with songs
  of freedom, and tons of strong beer: it is easier to please
  a man with one good head, than a monster with ten
  thousand, all bad ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
<p>Wherever the extent is considerable, and the lands
  properly formed for the purpose, the mode of natural
  Gardening, just recommended, ought certainly to be
  employed in preference to any other, as it surpasses all
  others in perfection, and is yet most easily executed:
  but in or near great cities, where property is much divided,
  on flats, where nature has no play, in all tame
  situations; the richer and more artificial manner of our
  Gardening is preferable: because it may contain much
  variety in a small compass, and corrects the natural
  defects of the ground more speedily, more effectually,
  with less charge than any other.</p>
<p>This manner is also properest for grounds that immediately
  surround elegant structures, where order and
  symmetry are absolutely necessary; and for many little
  enclosures, or resting-places of various kinds, that must
  always be dispersed in different parts of extensive plantations;
  where nicety of dress, and excessive decoration
  are in character; and where they may be conveniently
  secured with stronger fences, to guard them from public
  intrusion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<p>These choice pieces of cultivation are appropriated to
  the owner and his select friends; set aside for convivial
  pleasures, and enjoyments that can only be tasted in
  private: they may be considered as more spacious apartments,
  as habitations adapted to the milder seasons of
  the year, in which Art and Nature unite to furnish a
  variety of whatever is beautiful, elegant, extraordinary
  or entertaining; whilst the larger improvements are suited
  to the more open amusements of the owner, contrived
  upon a bolder system, for a more distant and cursory
  inspection: they are a noble indication of his consequence;
  a benevolent, as well as artful tribute to the community;
  which, whilst it serves to multiply the conveniencys, or
  promote the innocent amusements of the public, secures
  the popularity of the benefactor, and marks, in the
  strongest colours, his power, wealth and munificence.
  How these considerations operate in England, I, who
  am a stranger, cannot determine; but in the kingdoms
  of the East they have great weight.</p>
<p>Your connoisseurs will, I know, object to our artificial
  scenery; which they consider as unnatural, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> represent as too expensive for imitation. On the former
  of these points you have already heard my sentiments; I
  need not now repeat them: those who are not yet convinced,
  may still feed on crabs, and leave ananas to
  better heads.</p>
<p>Till my arrival in England, I never doubted but
  the appearance of art was admissible, even necessary
  to the essence of a splendid Garden: and I am more
  firmly of that opinion, after having seen your English
  Gardens; though the contrary is so violently maintained
  by your countrymen, in opposition to the
  rest of the world, to the practice of all other polished
  nations, all enlightened ages; and, as far as I am able
  to judge, in opposition to reason. But your people
  delight in extremes; and, whenever they get upon a
  new scent, pursue it with such rage, that they always
  overshoot the bounds. We admire Nature as much as
  you do; but being of a more phlegmatick disposition,
  our affections are somewhat better regulated: we consider
  how she may be employed, upon every occasion, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> most advantage; and do not always introduce her in the
  same garb; but show her in a variety of forms; sometimes
  naked, as you attempt to do; sometimes disguised;
  sometimes decorated, or assisted by art; scrupulously
  avoiding, in our most artless dispositions, all resemblance
  to the common face of the country, with which the
  Garden is immediately surrounded; being convinced,
  that a removal from one field to another, of the same
  appearance, can never afford any particular pleasure, nor
  ever excite powerful sensations of any kind.</p>
<p>If I must tell you my mind freely, Gentlemen, both
  your artists and connoisseurs seem to lay too much stress
  on nature and simplicity; they are the constant cry of
  every half-witted dabbler, the burthen of every song,
  the tune by which you are insensibly lulled into dullness
  and insipidity. If resemblance to nature were the measure
  of perfection, the waxen figures in Fleet-street,
  would be superior to all the works of the divine Buonarotti;
  the trouts and wood-cocks of Elmer, preferable
  to the cartoons of Raphael: but, believe me, too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> nature is often as bad as too little, as may be deduced
  from many examples, obvious to every man conversant
  in polite knowledge. Whatever is familiar, is by no
  means calculated to excite the strongest feelings; and
  though a close resemblance to familiar objects may
  delight the ignorant, yet, to the skilful, it has but few
  charms, never any of the most elevated sort; and is sometimes
  even disgusting: without a little assistance from art,
  nature is seldom tolerable; she may be compared to
  certain viands, either tasteless, or unpleasant in themselves:
  which, nevertheless, with some seasoning, become
  palatable; or, when properly prepared, compose a most
  exquisite dish.</p>
<p>And with respect to simplicity, wherever more is
  admitted than may be requisite to constitute grandeur,
  or necessary to facilitate conception, it is always a fault.
  To the human mind, some exertion is always necessary:
  it must be occupied to be pleased; and is more satisfied
  with a treat, than with a frugal repast: for though it
  doth not delight in intricacies, yet, without a certain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> even a considerable degree of complication, no grateful
  sensations can ever be excited. Excessive simplicity can
  only please the ignorant or weak, whose comprehensions
  are slow, and whose powers of combination are confined.</p>
<p>Simplicity must therefore be used with discretion, and
  the dose be adapted to the constitution of the patients,
  amongst savages and Hottentots; where arts are unknown,
  refinements unheard of, an abundant portion may be
  necessary; but wherever civilization has improved the
  mental faculties, a little, with proper management, will
  go a very great way: need I prove what the music,
  poetry, language, arts and manners, of every nation
  demonstrate, beyond the possibility of a doubt.</p>
<p>Another favourite word of your virtuosi, is purity; a
  word of which, being a stranger, I do not perhaps know
  the full value; nor exactly in what sense it is applied to
  the art in question. We are told, that in the purity of
  Gardening, you were never equalled by any nation;
  even that this boasted purity never appeared in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> country but England: it may be so; your Gardens have
  certainly been purged to the quick, freed of every encumberance,
  and cleansed of every extrinsick redundancy;
  so that nothing now remains but the genuine carcass, in
  its native purity: yet whether this quality, which I
  apprehend is the only one that can positively be implied,
  is a perfection or a blemish, will always be disputed; for
  though pure wine<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> is, without doubt, a delicious beverage,
  and preferable to that which is mixed, yet pure water is
  very insipid, and may be much mended, by the additions
  of arrack, lemon and sugar, to turn it into punch; and
  ninety-nine persons in a hundred will maintain, that
  your pure Gardens might be much improved by the
  addition of embellishments proper to produce variety,
  and set off the vegetation to advantage: for vary your
  trees and shrubs as much as possible, combine them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> every imaginable arrangement, they are still but trees
  and shrubs; they can impress but a very few images
  upon the mind of the spectator, and only affect his
  senses with very slight perceptions.</p>
<p>That our artificial stile of Gardening is expensive, is
  doubtless true; yet certainly not ruinously so. In my
  former voyage, I knew an unfortunate prince, who, on
  a very moderate allowance from his relations, supported
  a court in splendour; and, with the surplus, formed one
  of the most extraordinary, as well as magnificent artificial
  Gardens I ever saw. It is surprizing what good management
  will do, where management is necessary; but
  you are too rich ever to need it in any thing. I have
  seen more money expended here, in digging an ugly
  pond, than would have compleated a whole Garden elsewhere;
  yet, after all, the pond would never hold water.
  But, to proceed&mdash;You have all seen what the French
  have done at Versailles, Marli, Trianon, Saint Cloud,
  Liancourt, and Chanilly; the Italians near Rome, at
  Tivoli, at Frescati, and in many other parts of Italy: I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> do not here enter into the merit of these works; but
  they are certainly as costly, perhaps more so, than any
  of ours; yet these were done by foreigners, of different
  denominations; all without the least help of magick: you
  are richer than they; you may, with some trouble,
  acquire their skill; it is hoped you have already more
  than their spirit: be not, therefore, afraid to attempt,
  what they have already long since accomplished.</p>
<p>I have formerly told you what sort of art we employ
  in our Chinese Gardening; I now recommend it to your
  imitation; and though in general your European artificial
  manner appears not to me perfect, yet doth it contain
  many things highly deserving notice, which you
  have imprudently laid aside, without substituting any
  equivalent.</p>
<p>To instance the Gardens of France; they are, I will
  allow, sufficiently extravagant: you hear of nothing but
  islands of love, or halls of festivity; every recess is the
  retreat of a God, every prospect a scene of enchantment:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> like their petit maitres, they are all out of nature, all
  affectation; yet it is an affectation often delightful, and
  absurdity generally overflowing with taste and fancy: in
  their best works there is such a mysterious, pleasing intricacy
  in the disposition, such variety in the objects, so
  much splendour and animation in the scenery, and so
  much skill apparent in the execution of every part, that
  the attention of the spectator never flags; the succession
  is so rapid, that he is hurried on from one exhibition to
  another, with his mind constantly upon the stretch: he
  has only time to be pleased; there is no leisure to reflect,
  none to be disgusted with the extravagance of what he
  sees. If their Gardens are less rational than yours, they
  are certainly much more entertaining; and though, upon
  the whole, they can by no means be proposed as models
  for imitation, yet are there many things to be borrowed
  from them, which might be adopted by you with considerable
  advantage.</p>
<p>I may say the same with regard to the Italian Gardens,
  of which the style is less affected, less extravagant than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> in those of France: the heat of the climate obliges the
  inhabitants to seek for shade; the walks are sheltered,
  the plantations close, whence their compositions have a
  gloom, and an air of solitude that are exceedingly awful.
  There is a grandeur of manner in all their works, seldom
  to be met with elsewhere; which, about Rome, and in
  some other parts of Italy, is greatly heightened by the
  majestick face of Nature, framed upon a larger scale,
  and broken into nobler forms, than in most other
  countries.  Their vegetation too is uncommonly picturesque;
  the abundance of water with which they are
  every where supplied, enables them to form a thousand
  pleasing combinations; and the venerable vestiges of
  ancient structures, which rear their decaying heads above
  the plantations, add surprizingly to the dignity of the
  scenery.</p>
<p>At every step, the admiration of the spectator is
  excited by statues, therms, bas-reliefs, sarcophagi urns,
  vases, and other remains of ancient splendour; or he is
  delighted with the productions of modern artists, ingeniously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> imagined, well executed, and skilfully disposed.
  It is not easy to conceive any thing more entertaining,
  to a man of taste, than an Italian Garden; in which,
  amidst a profusion of pleasing objects, the same elegance
  of choice, the same elevation of style so conspicuous in
  the sculpture and painting of the great Italian schools, is
  every where prevalent.</p>
<p>To branch out into farther descriptions of your continental
  Gardens, is perhaps superfluous, and may be
  thought foreign to the present purpose; as some of them
  differ very little from those just mentioned; and others
  are too trifling, or imperfect, to deserve any notice:
  yet permit me, before I finish, to give a slight sketch of
  the Dutch Gardening; from which I am apt to believe
  your ideas of the artificial style are chiefly collected, and
  your extraordinary aversion to it principally owing.</p>
<p>In Holland, parterres, embroidered in box, brick-dust,
  sea-coal, and broken porcelain, are every where admired.
  No Garden is perfect, that is not surrounded with a wet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> ditch, and many <i>lusthouses</i> hanging over it, for smoking
  tobacco; nor is there any elegance, without some tons
  of lead, transformed into skating Dutchmen, Harlequins,
  and fluting Shepherdesses, all richly painted, in proper
  colours: azure flower-pots, with gilt handles, are seen
  in every corner; and golden mercury are perched, like
  birds, upon every pinnacle: every pass is guarded by
  pasteboard Grenadiers; and Fame, straddling over the
  entrance, displays a Dutch label to the passenger, telling
  the name and beauties of the place, the virtues and
  moral opinions of the proprietor. These particularities,
  with all the formal absurd parts of the French Gardening,
  make an Eden in Holland; a thing too ridiculous to be
  out of humour with any where; 'tis a pity it has had so
  serious an effect upon you. You are a wise people; yet,
  in the reformation of Gardening, you have followed the
  beaten road of ignorance: to avoid one fault, you have
  run headlong into another, its opposite: because, in
  the Old Gardening, art, order and variety, were carried
  to an extravagant excess, you have, in the New, almost
  totally excluded them all three: to mend an exuberant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> fantastick dress, you have stripped stark naked: and, to
  heal a distempered limb, you have, like some famous
  surgeons of our day, chopped it entirely off.</p>
<p>All connoisseurs amongst you, and even amongst us,
  agree in despising our enchanted, or supernatural scenery;
  which, they say, is trifling, absurd, extravagant, abounding
  in conceits and boyish tricks; that operating chiefly
  by surprize, it has little or no effect, after a first or
  second inspection, and consequently can afford no pleasure
  to the owner: yet our best Artists, who have no excessive
  reverence for the decrees of connoisseurs<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, and who
  think the owner is not the only person to be entertained,
  often introduce it; either where the plan is extensive,
  and admits of many changes; or, where the ground is
  barren of natural varieties: saying, in their vindication,
  that it serves as an interlude between more serious expositions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> that, at a treat, there should be meats for every
  palate; in a shop of general resort, goods for every fancy;
  in a Garden, designed for publick inspection, exhibitions
  of every kind; that all may find something to their
  liking, and none go away disappointed or dissatisfied:
  and, as at a feast, men eat of what they best relish,
  without mumbling the rest of the dishes, but leave them
  untainted for others to feed upon, so, in a Garden, if a
  man be too wise to laugh, or be pleased with trifles, he
  may pass them over unnoticed: amongst the multitude,
  there are many fancies to gratify; children, old women,
  eunuchs, and pleasure-misses, ought to be diverted, as
  well as sages, mandarines, or connoisseurs. It is not
  every one, say they, that enjoys the force or fierceness
  of grand compositions; to some they are even terrifying:
  weak minds delight in little objects, which are easiest
  adapted to their confined comprehensions; as children
  are better pleased with a puppet-show, than with more
  serious or noble performances.</p>
<p>Thus they reason; and say moreover, that, as the principal
  parts of this supernatural Gardening consists in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> display of many surprizing phenomena, and extraordinary
  effects, produced by air, fire, water, motion, light, and
  gravitation, they may be considered at a collection of philosophical
  experiments, exhibited in a better manner, upon
  a larger scale, and more forcibly than is common: in that
  light they think, even men of sense may venture to look
  at them, without impeachment of their understanding; to
  admire what is ingenious, new or extraordinary; and
  stare at what they do not comprehend. Whether the connoisseurs
  or the artists are most in the wrong, I will not
  decide; you, Gentlemen, must determine for yourselves.</p>
<p>Some free expressions, relative to your Gardeners,
  constitute a heavy part of the charge exhibited against
  me: it seems therefore necessary, in alleviation of this
  high offence, to declare, that whatever has been said on
  that subject, was with an eye to the general character of
  the fraternity; and by no means levelled at yon stately
  gentleman in the black perriwig, as he has been pleased
  to maintain. It could not be my business to mark out
  individuals, either by excessive praise, which was perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> expected, or by more poignant censure: such conduct
  must have been fawning in one in instance, invidious in
  both; for there is no exalting one ph&#339;nomenon, without
  proportionably degrading the rest: as in a draw-well,
  one bucket can never rise, but when the other sinks.
  If a man far outstrips his brothers, he will of course be
  distinguished; if only a little, his safest station is in the
  croud. And really it is odd that any one should officiously
  have stepped out of the ranks, insisting, like master
  Dogberry in the play, upon his exclusive title; where
  nothing partial was even distantly hinted at, no names
  mentioned, nor any thing said, that was not full as applicable
  to the brotherhood in general, as to the sagacious
  claimant in particular: but</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0"><i>Man lup jao kai</i><br />
    </span> <span class="i0"><i>Tai kup tao ba&iuml;.</i><br />
    </span> </div>
</div>
<p>There is reason to believe, from various hints which
  have been dropped by Gentlemen here present, that the
  veracity of Chet-qua's description is doubted; nay, that
  the Gardens described, are supposed to have no existence
  but in Chet-qua's brain: be it so, my friends; I shall
  not seek to refute what you seem so strongly disposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> believe; it is not at present material: for the end of all
  that I have said, was rather as an Artist, to set before
  you a new style of Gardening; than as a Traveller, to
  relate what I have really seen: and, notwithstanding
  your strictures, you all seemed satisfied, even entertained
  with the description: there is no doubt, but the reality,
  like all other realities, would affect you still more
  strongly than the picture. I have endeavoured to shew,
  how that may be obtained: the rest is left to those it
  most concerns; the ingenious, the wealthy, and the
  great; who have power and inclinations to execute what
  I attempt to plan: my part is done, as far as I am able
  to do it; theirs may begin when they think fit.</p>
<p>And although they may at first be embarrassed in the
  execution of a system so much more complicated and dependant
  on genius, on skill, and on nice judgement,
  than that which has hitherto been pursued; yet there is
  no doubt, but practice and perseverance will, by degrees,
  dispel every difficulty: it is at least glorious to hazard
  arduous attempts; and more honourable even to fail in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> manly pursuits, than to succeed in trifling, childish enterprizes.
  Let the timid or the feeble meanly creep upon
  the earth, with uniform, sluggard pace; but the towering
  spirit must attempt a nobler flight, and climb the paths
  that lead to fame: now gayly sporting on the slippery
  surface, as doth the gentle, graceful lizard; now thundering
  up the precipice, with the tremendous dragon's
  stride; now soaring to the top, stately and splendid as
  the imperial bird;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> when, with his glittering crest and
  twelve irradiant wings, he comes upon the morning's
  light, while myriads of the warbling tribes, at awful
  distance, crowd the vaulted air, adore their King, and,
  with loud songs of frantick joy, shake the firm earth,
  and all yon starry heaven.</p>
<p>From the whole tenour of this Discourse, and indeed
  from the substance of the first Dissertation, it is evident,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> Gentlemen, that your servant Chet-qua has no aversion
  to natural Gardening; but is, on the contrary, a zealous
  advocate in its favour, wherever there is room to expand,
  and work upon a great scale, or where it can conveniently,
  and with propriety be introduced. The style which in
  England has been adopted, preferable to others, is not
  what appears to him reprehensible; but he laments the
  little use you have made of your adoption, and apprehends
  your partiality is too excessive, while you
  obstinately refuse the assistance of almost every extraneous
  embellishment, and persist in an indiscriminate application
  of the same manner, upon all occasions, however
  opposite, or ill adapted; and often where no probability
  of success appears. Natural Gardening, when
  treated upon an extensive plan, when employed with
  judgement, and conducted with art, is perhaps as
  superior to all other sorts of culture, as heroick verse
  is to every other species of writing; but there are
  many occasions, where neither the one nor the other
  can, with the least propriety, be employed; where
  they would only serve to give a ridicule to the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> composition; and where different or less elevated modes
  of expression are, on all accounts, preferable. Artists
  of other professions, vary their manners of applying to
  the human affections; suiting them to the circumstances
  or nature of the subjects before them; and they are
  oftenest indebted to these variations for their success;
  why then should Gardeners always confine themselves to
  the same tract, and torture all dispositions to adapt them
  to the same method, like that tyrant of old, who stretched
  or mutilated every guest, till he fitted a particular bed?
  Can they hope to succeed by means, which others have
  found ineffectual; or is it reasonable to suppose, that
  Nature will change her course to please their fancy?
  Variety is a powerful agent, without the assistance of
  which, little can be effected; it captivates even with
  trifles; and, when united to perfection, has charms
  which nothing can resist: the most exquisite pictures of
  nature, receive additional beauties from a judicious opposition
  of art; and the confined, uniform, tasteless walk
  of imitation, which you have unfortunately fallen into,
  must have many helps to make it even tolerable; a thousand
  enlivening additions, to animate its native dulness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus I have considered every part of my first Discourse,
  and offered in its vindication, what immediately
  occurs to me: perhaps, with more leisure, I might have
  contrived a better Speech, and a stronger Defence; but
  the hurry of Face-making<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> is such, that there is scarcely
  time to eat rice, or drink brandy,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> much less to think:
  I never frequent my wives but by night; I have only
  heard one of them scold, and seen the others by twilight,
  these six months: judge then, what can be expected from
  Chet-qua; the little knowledge he has, or thinks he
  has, is freely communicated to his neighbours; he wishes
  it were more and better; yet such as it is, he flatters
  himself it will be kindly received; and that his neighbours
  will use what may be useful, without kicking too
  violently at the rest.</p>

    is part of a poem written by Kien-long, reigning emperor of China, in praise
    of drinking tea: and published, by his imperial edict, bearing date the
    twelfth day, of the ninth moon, of the thirteenth year of his reign; in thirty-two
    different types, or characters; under the inspection of Yun-lou, and Houng-yen,
    princes, by the title of Tsin-ouang; Fouheng, grandee, by the title of
    Taypao; Count, by the title of Valiant; and first president of almost all the
    great tribunals of the empire: whose deputies were Akdoun and Tsing-pou,
    grandees, by the title of Tay-tsee Chaopao; and these were again assisted by
    Isan, Fouki, Elguingue, Tetchi, Mingt&eacute;, Tsoungmin, Tchangyu, Tounmin,
    and about a dozen other mandarines of rank and reputation; so that there
    is no doubt but the work is perfectly correct. Here follows the exact copy
    of it, with an English translation, for the entertainment and instruction of the
    curious in poetry. There is a French translation of the same work, by Father
    Amiot, published at Paris, in 1770, from which the present Publication is
    in a great measure taken; the Editor having found it easier to translate
    from the French copy, than from the Chinese original. </p>

  <p class="tdc"> TRANSLATION </p>
  <p> The colours of the Mei hoa are never brilliant, yet is the flower always
    pleasing: in fragrance or neatness the fo-cheou has no equal: the fruit of the
    pine is aromatick, its odour inviting. In gratifying at once the sight, the
    smell and the taste, nothing exceeds these three things: and if, at the same
    time, you put, upon a gentle fire, an old pot, with three legs, grown black
    and battered with length of service, after having first filled it with the limpid
    water of melted snow; and if, when the water is heated to a degree that will
    boil a fish, or redden a lobster, you pour it directly into a cup made of the
    earth of yu&eacute;, upon the tender leaves of superfine tea; and if you let it rest
    there, till the vapours which rises at first in great abundance, forming thick
    clouds, dissipate by degrees, and at last appear merely as a slight mist upon
    the surface; and if then you gently sip this delicious beverage, it is labouring
    effectually to remove the five causes of discontent which usually disturb our
    quiet: you may feel, you may taste, but it is impossible to describe the sweet
    tranquillity which a liquor, thus prepared, procures. </p>
  <p> Retired, for some space of time, from the tumults of business, I sit alone
    in my tent, at liberty to enjoy myself unmolested: in one hand holding a
    fo-cheou, which I bring nearer to my nose, or put it farther off, at pleasure;
    in the other hand holding my dish of tea, upon which some pretty curling
    vapours still appear: I taste, by intervals the liquor; by intervals, I consider
    the mei-hoa&mdash;I give a fillip to my imagination, and my thoughts are naturally
    turned towards the sages of antiquity.&mdash;I figure to myself the famous Ou-tsuen,
    whose only nourishment was the fruit of the pine; he enjoyed himself in quiet,
    amidst this rigid frugality! I envy, and wish to imitate him.&mdash;I put a few of
    the kernels into my mouth; I find them delicious. </p>
  <p> Sometimes, methinks, I see the virtuous Lin-fou, bending into form, with
    his own hands, the branches of the mei-hoa-chou. It was thus, say I to myself,
    that he relieved his mind, after the fatigues of profound meditation, on the
    most interesting subjects. Then I take a look at my shrub, and it seems as if I
    were assisting Lin-fou, in bending its branches into a new form.&mdash;I skip from
    Lin-fou to Tchao-tcheon, or to Yu-tchouan; and see the first in the middle of
    a vast many tea-cups, filled with all kinds of tea, of which he sometimes tastes
    one, sometimes another; thus varying incessantly his potation: while the
    second drinks, with the profoundest indifference, the best tea, and scarcely
    distinguishes it from the vilest stuff.&mdash;My taste is not their's; why should I
    attempt to imitate them?&mdash;&mdash; </p>
  <p> But I hear the sound of the evening bell; the freshness of the night is
    augmented; already the rays of the moon strike through the windows of my
    tent, and with their lustre brighten the few moveables with which it is adorned.
    I find myself neither uneasy nor fatigued; my stomach is empty, and I may,
    without fear, go to rest.&mdash;&mdash;It is thus that, with my poor abilities, I have
    made these verses, in the little spring of the tenth moon of the year Ping-yn,
    of my reign Kien-long.</p>

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
